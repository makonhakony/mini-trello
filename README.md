# SKIPLI Coding Challenge

This is made for the SKIPLI Online Coding challenge

I was doing this for around 24 hours.

## How it runs

run with React.js and Express.js.
`npm install && npm start`

 UI is stored in "/src" and server is stored in "/server"

 All secrets are revoked, you have to input your GitHub OAuth secret and Firebase service account

This challenge is cool, love it ðŸ˜‚ However, I don't have enough time to finish all of this. I finish a part of backend, full frontend for testing and authorization with github. I can deploy it to my home server if you would like to see it live. Thank you!
