I was doing this for around 24 hours, Thank you!

This challenge is cool, love it ðŸ˜‚ However, I don't have enough time to finish all of this. I finish a part of backend, full frontend for testing and authorization with github. I can deploy it to my home server if you would like to see it live. Thank you!
